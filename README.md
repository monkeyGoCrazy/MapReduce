•Implemented a simplified Hadoop Map-Reduce framework that was capable of handling customized computation jobs and fault tolerance, providing interfaces such as mapper, reducer, master, slave and heartbeat.

•Solved the synchronization issues and task scheduling using Zookeeper as a coordinator.

•Designed heartbeat to support slave node failures and task rescheduling.

•Implemented the word count program and tested on 8.5 GB raw data on 5 virtual machines using 192s.
